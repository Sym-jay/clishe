Clishe - describe what you want in plain English.

Usage:
  clishe                    start an interactive session
  clishe explain <command>  explain what a command does, then exit
  clishe "<phrase>"         look up a phrase in your knowledge base (does not run it)
  clishe --list             show the phrases you've taught
  clishe practice [lesson]  hands-on exercises in a safe, throwaway folder
                            (clishe practice --list shows the lessons)
  clishe progress           the commands you've learned to type yourself
  clishe setup              find or set up a local AI model
  clishe tour               a quick tour of your computer
  clishe doctor             check your setup, and how to fix anything wrong
  clishe sheet              your own cheat sheet (save: clishe sheet > cheatsheet.txt)
  clishe check '<command>'  is it safe to run? (or: clishe check script.sh)
  clishe --init bash|zsh    print the Ctrl+G shortcut for your normal shell
                            (add  eval "$(clishe --init bash)"  to ~/.bashrc,
                             or   eval "$(clishe --init zsh)"   to ~/.zshrc)
  clishe --plain ...        words instead of symbols and drawings (screen readers);
                            or set "plain": true in ~/.config/clishe/config.json
  clishe --version          show the version
  clishe --help             show this help

Inside a session, also try: help, learned, teach, forget <phrase>, practice,
progress, setup, tour, exit
EOF
}

session_help() {
    cat <<'EOF'
Type what you want in plain English ("show me disk usage"), or any normal
shell command. Clishe shows you the command before it runs.

  explain <command>   what does a command do? (also: "what does ls do")
  what does this mean explain the output of the command you just ran
  fix that            explain why the last command failed, and fix it
  undo that           reverse the last change (mv, cp, mkdir, touch, chmod, cd, Trash)
  check <command>     is it safe? what would it change? (also a script file)
  learned             list the phrases you've taught me
  teach               teach me a phrase -> command (or fix a wrong one)
  forget <phrase>     forget a phrase you taught me
  practice            hands-on exercises in a safe, throwaway folder
  progress            the commands you've learned to type yourself
  setup               find or set up a local AI model
  tour                a quick tour of your computer
  doctor              check your setup, and how to fix anything wrong
  sheet               your own cheat sheet of the commands you've learned
  help                show this message
  exit                leave (Ctrl-D works too)

Commands with <placeholders>, like "cp <file> <destination>", ask you to
fill in each value before running.

After you've asked for the same thing a few times, I'll ask you to type the
command yourself. Set "learn_mode" to "always" or "off" in the config to
change that.

Want this in your normal shell too? Add this line to ~/.bashrc:
  eval "$(clishe --init bash)"
(or, for zsh, eval "$(clishe --init zsh)" to ~/.zshrc)
Then type plain English at any prompt and press Ctrl+G.

First time here? Try typing one of these:

  show me disk usage        how full your disk is
  list files                what's in this folder
  how much memory is free   how much RAM you have left
  explain tar -xzvf         what each part of a command means
  delete a file             (I always ask before anything risky)
  tour                      a quick tour of your own computer

After any command, ask "what does this mean" to understand its output.
You can also use me in your normal terminal with Ctrl+G. Type 'help' to see how.

WELCOME
